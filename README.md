# Unexpected Results with Negative Numbers in Julia Function

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Julia related to the handling of negative numbers in a simple function. The function aims to square the input, regardless of its sign, but it produces unexpected results for negative inputs. 

The `bug.jl` file contains the buggy code, and the `bugSolution.jl` file demonstrates the correct implementation.
